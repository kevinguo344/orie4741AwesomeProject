## Project Description
We have a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/y-combinator-companies) that has the name, year, type, url and batch of all companies that have gone through Y Combinator's incubator up to Summer 2016. [Y Combinator's website] (http://www.ycombinator.com/companies) also has a list of all the companies that had joined in the batches since 2016. We will cross reference the data from the dataset and the website with data from [Crunchbase's API](https://data.crunchbase.com/docs).

The goal of the project is to see the common traits between startups and/or founders that are chosen by Y-Combinator for the prestigious accelerator, whether these startups were more successful compared to other startups (through metrics such as valuation, fundings, IPO's and/or acquisition), and which early-stage startups are likely to be chosen by Y-Combinator in the future. This is important because it will allow investors to determine which startups are more likely to succeed, especially in the early-stage where it's difficult to determine how well a startup will perform. It will also be important for incubators such as Y-Combinator in determining if their selection process is flawed or biased in a way that blinds it from selecting startups that are likely to be successful in the future.
